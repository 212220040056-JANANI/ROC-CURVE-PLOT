# <p align="center"> ROC CURVE PLOT </p>
## Aim:
   To write python code to plot ROC curve used in ANN.
## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner /Google Colab

## Related Theory Concept:
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is frequently used for evaluating the performance of binary classification algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of a classifier’s performance, rather than a single value like most other metrics. First, let’s establish that in binary classification, there are four possible outcomes for a test prediction: true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative. The ROC curve is produced by calculating and plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate for a single classifier at a variety of thresholds.

Uses of ROC Curve :

1.One advantage presented by ROC curves is that they aid us in finding a classification threshold that suits our specific problem.

2.On the other hand, if our classifier is predicting whether someone has a terminal illness, we might be ok with a higher number of false positives (incorrectly diagnosing the illness), just to make sure that we don’t miss any true positives (people who actually have the illness).
